| ---------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `crowdstrike_detected_application` | **HAS**               | `crowdstrike_vulnerability` |

## [3.1.2] - 2022-01-05

### Changed

- Collection period for devices extended to 50 days from 30.

## Added

- Added config properties for `vulnerabilitiesLimit` and `devicesLimit`.

## [3.1.1] - 2022-01-01

### Changed

- Add `exprtRating` and `exploitStatus` to `crowdstrike_vulnerability`.
- Raise vulnerability endpoint limit to `400`.

## [3.0.3] - 2022-08-29

## [3.0.0] - 2022-08-10

### Added

- Added the ability to filter vulnerabilities by `closed` status and by
  vulnerability `severity`.
  - `closed` vulnerabilities will be filtered by default. They can be included
    by passing the `INCLUDE_CLOSED_VULNERABILITIES` environment variable with
    the value `true`.
  - `LOW` and `NONE` level severities will be excluded by default. The included
    vulnerability severities can be configured by passing comma separated
    severities (e.g. "CRITICAL,HIGH,MEDIUM,LOW,NONE,UNKNOWN") in the environment
    variable `VULNERABILITY_SEVERITIES`.

### Changed

- Various code style and quality updates

## [2.2.6] - 2022-08-01

### Fixed

- corrected creation of query parameters to only include pagination details at
  most once and default to using details returned by the CrowdStrike API

## [2.2.5] - 2022-08-01

### Changed

- increase page size to 250 for devices, prevention policy, and prevention
  policy members endpoints

## [2.2.4] - 2022-07-28

### Changed

- log all errors during pagiation

## [2.2.3] - 2022-07-27

### Changed

- increased page size to 250 when fetching vulnerabilities
- removed `await` from `hasKey` operations
- added `return` after `abort()` during error handling

## [2.2.2] - 2022-07-08

### Fixed

- Handle redirects manually. Dependabot node-fetch upgrade removed auth headers
  when redirecting.

## [2.2.1] - 2022-06-28

### Fixed

- `crowdstrike_sensor`'s should map to `aws_instance` entities when the
  CrowdStrike device's `service_provider` property has the value `AWS_EC2_V2`

## [2.2.0] - 2022-06-09

### Added

- The integration now allows users to optionally specify an availability zone in
  the configuration.

## [2.1.11] - 2022-06-03

### Fixed

- Fixed incorrect relationship `_type`. `crowdstrike_vuln_exploits_sensor` was
  renamed to `crowdstrike_vulnerability_exploits_sensor`. This allows the
  `partial` flag to be appropriately applied to the relationship.

## [2.1.10] - 2022-05-25

### Changed

- Enable Vulnerability ingestion for all accounts. If permissions are not
  enabled for vuln endpoints, warning is published to the event log.
- Removed getStepStartStates.ts

## [2.1.9] - 2022-05-24

### Changed

- Added error logging to the `FalconAPIClient`

## [2.1.8] - 2022-05-13

### Changed

- Added improved error retry logic.
- Added validateInvocation logic. Thanks [jakopako](https://github.com/jakopako)

- `code-ql` workflow
- `quesitons` workflow
- managed questions

## [2.1.6] - 2022-04-26

- `createFalconAPIClient` now follows a singleton pattern. This allows multiple
  steps to run independently and share the single api rate limit.

## [2.1.5] - 2022-04-18

### Changed

- Change the \_class designation of the vulnerability entity from
  `Vulnerability` to `Finding`.
- Add additional properties to the vulnerability entity, including: `id`, `cid`,

## [2.0.5] - 2021-10-07

### Fixed

  `x-ratelimit-retryafter` header was not properly respected because the header
  returned an epoch time in seconds, and we compared this to the current epoch
  time in milliseconds.
